gibson is a cross-functional suite of tools used to assist in provisioning and
maintaining Tor services.  gibson doesn't replace tools such as ezjail, iocell,
bhyve, nginx, caddy, LUKS and geli, but rather aims to glue them together into
secure Tor services.

The aim of the project is to provide the tools necessary for a user to quickly
and easily turn a new BSD installation into a Tor appliance in a safe and
reproducible fashion.

gibson is a project of Emerald Onion, and is available on our github.
